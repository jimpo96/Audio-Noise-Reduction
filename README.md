# Audio Noise Reduction

## Author

Contributor name : Dimitrios Kaoutzanis

### This repository contains two separate Google Colab notebooks for audio noise reduction. The first notebook is designed for working with pre-recorded audio files, while the second notebook records audio and performs noise reduction in real-time.

## &rarr; Notebook 1: Noise Reduction with Pre-recorded Audio

Step 1: Download the 'wave_file_noise_reduction.ipynb' file and then upload it to your Google Colab

Step 2: Open the 'wave_file_noise_reduction.ipynb' notebook into Colab

Step 3: Download the 'author.wav' file

Step 4: Follow the instructions and run the cells to perform noise reduction on the uploaded audio


## &rarr; Notebook 2: Real-time Noise Reduction with Audio Recording

Step 1: Open the 'real_time_noise_reduction.ipynb' notebook into Colab

Step 2: Run the notebook cells to start recording audio and perform noise reduction in real-time


### Note: Make sure to check and install any necessary dependencies specified in the notebooks
